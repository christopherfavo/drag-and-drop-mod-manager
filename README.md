# Dark Souls Drag and Drop Mod Manager
A program that makes installing mods for Dark Souls easier.

Requires the .NET framework to work properly.

File types that work with DSDAD:
* FSB(sound mods)
* MSB(enemy and/or object placement mods)

Any DCX files found in the game:
* .*.PARAMBND.DCX (parameter mods, such as [Aggression mod](http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/1265/?), [Custom Starting Classes](http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/1215/?), [All enemies are Gravelord](http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/1176/))
* .*.EMEVD.DCX (event mods, such as HotPocketRemix's [Estus Quest](https://github.com/HotPocketRemix/DSEventScriptTools/tree/master/Mods/EstusQuest))
* .*.PARTSBND.DCX (modelswap mods, such as [Crown of Dusk Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/1344/?))
* .*.MSGBND.DCX (text mods, such as [Improved texts](https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/1198/?), or custom translations.) for example.
